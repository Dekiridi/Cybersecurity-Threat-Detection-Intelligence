# Cybersecurity: Threat-Intelligence-Analysis
A comprehensive threat intelligence analysis of Densa State Government’s digital infrastructure (densastate.gov.ng), uncovering vulnerabilities, and threat intelligence analysis targeting government digital infrastructures, profiling APT groups like Wizard Spider..

## 📚 Overview
This repository showcases my cybersecurity capstone project, which integrates **Security Operations Center (SOC) threat detection** with **threat intelligence analysis** for real-world scenarios.

The project simulates a layered defense using **Wireshark**, **pfSense**, and **Wazuh** to detect and mitigate cyberattacks like brute-force intrusions and unauthorized access. It also presents an in-depth **threat intelligence report** on a state government’s digital infrastructure, assessing vulnerabilities and profiling high-risk threat actors like **Wizard Spider**.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used
- **VirusTotal** — Malware and reputation scanning
- **Google Dorking** — Public data and document exposure discovery
- **Wayback Machine** — Historical snapshots and CMS profiling
- **theHarvester** — Subdomain and email enumeration
- **WHOIS Lookup** — Domain registration and ownership analysis
- **crt.sh** — SSL/TLS certificate transparency analysis

## 🛡️ Project Details

### 1. Threat Intelligence Analysis
- **Target**: Densastate.gov.ng (State Government)
- **Findings**:
  - Publicly exposed CMS vulnerabilities (WordPress, PHP backend).
  - One malware detected via VirusTotal.
  - Metadata leaks in public PDFs (usernames, software versions).
  - Over 30+ subdomains with wildcard certificates.
- **Threat Actor Profiling**:
  - **Wizard Spider**: Specializes in ransomware (Ryuk, Conti), phishing, TrickBot, and BazarLoader.
- **Risks**:
  - Service disruptions.
  - Data breaches.
  - Financial loss from ransomware.
